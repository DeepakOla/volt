## 🗑️ Files Deleted (Old Templates Removed)

The following **7 old ModernBiz Pro template files** have been permanently deleted:

1. ❌ `pages/homepage_business_excellence_platform.html`
2. ❌ `pages/services_interactive_capability_explorer.html`
3. ❌ `pages/work_portfolio_results_driven_showcase.html`
4. ❌ `pages/about_company_expertise_trust.html`
5. ❌ `pages/resources_authority_building_knowledge_hub.html`
6. ❌ `pages/contact_consultation_multi_channel_engagement.html`
7. ❌ `pages/culture_values_authentic_brand_story.html`

**Reason**: These were generic business templates with "ModernBiz Pro" branding that were causing confusion.
