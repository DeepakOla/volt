## 🚀 **WHAT MAKES IT WORK**

### **1. VISUAL STORYTELLING**
- **Before:** Text said "we connect manufacturers and labs"
- **After:** Visual *shows* the connection happening

### **2. BATTERY METAPHOR**
- Plus (+) terminal = Manufacturers (energy source)
- Minus (−) terminal = Labs (energy receiver)
- BharatVolt = The connection that completes the circuit
- **Result:** Power flows, value created!

### **3. PSYCHOLOGY**
- Symmetry creates balance and trust
- Gradient line shows flow/movement
- Animated dots = "something's happening"
- Hover effects = interactive, modern

### **4. CLEAR VALUE PROP**
- "Testing Made Simple" = promise
- 4 steps = simplicity proven
- 3000+ tests = social proof
- Visual connection = understanding
